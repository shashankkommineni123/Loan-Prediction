# loan_prediction_ApplAi
Predict if your loan will be accepted or not. This happens by using a labeled data for applicants who applied for a loan before, analyzing these data and using some classification models on it.<br>

I did that in machine learning workshop that was held by [ApplAi](https://github.com/ApplAi2023) "Student Activity at Ain Shams University" lasted 2 weeks..<br>

I used :
- âœ… Logistic Regression
- âœ… KNN
- âœ… SVM
- âœ… ID3
- âœ… Random Forrest
